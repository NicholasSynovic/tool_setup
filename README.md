## About

This repository is meant to keep track of:

- All of the software that I have installed,
- The package managers I've used to install the software,
- Manual instructions on how to install the software, and
- Automated scripts to install software.

Multiple different methods to install the same software package are provided in case 
I am working on a machine with UACs that prevent one method from installing software.

## Getting Started

For a manual installation, see [`MANUAL_INSTALL.csv`](MANUAL_INSTALL.csv).

For scripted installation, see the [`scripts`](scripts/) directory.
